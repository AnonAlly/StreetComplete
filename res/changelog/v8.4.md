### New Translation

Galician by Iv√°n Seoane

### Enhancements

- use a better jpeg quality for photo upload (80 instead of 60)
- show tunnels semi-transparently on the map
- show barriers/gates on the map
- indicate the direction of one-way streets on the map
- render private/semi-private roads differently on the map
- make algorithm that decides how to interpret the weekdays given on a opening hours plate more intuitive

### Fixes

- do not trigger automatic upload if not authorized yet (fixes #1253)
- avoid outputting lat/long coordinates in scientific notation because Overpass-API cannot parse this
- fix max height quest did not show for height restrictors and parking entrances (fixes #1245)
