### ðŸš§ Map maintenance

Quest types whose answer is likely to change over the years will be asked again in reasonable intervals. So now you can help not only to complete the map, but also to keep it up-to-date, which is at least as important.

Most prominently, you'll be asked if opening hours are still the same as before and be offered to correct them if they changed, the same with cycle tracks and lanes on roads.

This feature has been sponsored by the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF) as part of their new [microgrants](https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2020/07/01/osmf-microgrants-program-congratulations-to-selected-projects/) program. You can support the OSMF and other initiatives like these and have a say by [becoming a member](https://join.osmfoundation.org/), if you like.
