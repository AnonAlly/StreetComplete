## M-M-M-Mega Update!

A few things came together... this update contains what would usually be in 4 or so releases! Enjoy!

### 1Ô∏è‚É£Ô∏èÔ∏è Addresses Overlay

The most efficient way to map addresses on-site, even in places where no buildings are mapped yet!  
You can add addresses to buildings, edit existing ones and also add them at any new position, using the same sleek UI as for the address quests.

### üõçÔ∏è Shops Overlay

Easily map and check what shops exist in your local shopping area!

### üöÄ HUGE performance improvements (#4079, #4125), all by @Helium314

The app is now more responsive during normal use thanks to extensive caching and other improvements, in particular, roughly:

- 2x to 8x times faster display of quest pins and overlays
- 2x to 3x times faster showing of quest details
- up to 2x times faster solving of quests
- up to 2x faster upload and thus another 2x faster solving of quests if auto-sync is on (#4077, #4472)
- slightly faster download (#4469)
