- Faster downloads and faster display of nearby data (#3741), by @Helium314
- Faster initial download when starting the app
- Other small improvements, quest enhancements and UI fixes (#3736, #3757, #3719), thanks @mnalis, @matkoniecz
- Fixed display issue when going through the tutorial too fast (#3767)

### Un-Features

- Google Play version only: Removed donation links in the about screen because this is now against their policies unless those links lead to their own billing system (see #3768).
