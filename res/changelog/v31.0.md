(#2189, #2557) by @FloEdelmann

Lockdown fatigue? You could go on a walk together with your roommate or partner ‚Äì with the team mode, you can evenly divide up all quests among yourselves and map together!

It also works for groups of up to twelve people, but maybe wait with that until the pandemic is over üò∑. Happy mapping!
