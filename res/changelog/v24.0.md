Good News! StreetComplete received a grant from the [German Federal Ministry of Education and Research](https://www.bmbf.de/) within the frame of the [Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de/en/project/streetcomplete/), spanning over a period of 6 months! For the next few months, my focus is on adding new quest types, starting with this update!

### New Quests

- _Is this a one-way street? In which direction?_ (#1982, #2122)
- _Do these traffic lights have a tactile indication for blind people for when it's safe to cross?_ (#1330, #2127)
- _Which direction leads upwards for these steps?_ (#1817)
- _How may steps are here?_ (#875)

### Enhanced Quests
