### ðŸšŒðŸš´ Quest presets

- Show quests that are quick and easy to solve (from a distance) first by default. This makes contributing more efficient and diverse while also easier to do as e.g. a passenger (#2944, ...)
- You can now save different quest presets for different situations, e.g. one preset when you only want a solve some important quests while on a bus, or on a bike tour etc.  
This was a much requested feature: (#1301, #1654, #1746, #1987, #2054, #2069, #2279, #2565, #2308, #3034, #3216, ...)
