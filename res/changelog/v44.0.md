### ðŸ§­ Recording GPS track

Did you ever notice some path missing on OSM while solving quests? Now, you can walk that path and then attach it to a public note!  
Note that the track can only be recorded while the app is in foreground. So, it is not meant to replace tools like GPS Logger but to help locate short missing path segments and similar.
