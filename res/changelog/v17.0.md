This release includes a major update of the map rendering library (in order to satisfy new Google Play guidelines). I took this as an opportunity to re-do most of the things that concern the map view (#1279, #1606) and thus solve some long-standing issues with it. If any new have been introduced, please report them!

### Enhancements

- Faster start-up time of map, better performance
- Smoother zoom to a quest pin and back
- No or less of a flash when a solved quest pin is removed from the map
- Removed the confusing "glued to your location" functionality
- Create new note marker is now initially on users location if it is in view (#1422)
- Map now retains map focus on current quest / note when rotating the screen (#1524)
- Stop downloading quests when user changed activated quests in the settings (#1681)
- Treat metered wi-fis as mobile data (#1699)

### Fixes

- Location accuracy now displayed at correct scale during zooming (#1684)
- Quests pins should not disappear under certain circumstances anymore (#1698, #1689)
- Quest pin is removed from the map after splitting up the way (#1701)
- Minor layout fixes (#1548, #1702, #1703)

### Enhanced Quests

- Do not reorder last picked options for the track type quest form to the front (#1692)
- Moved building type quest importance up a bit because the housenumber quest is only shown after this one has been answered (#1717)
