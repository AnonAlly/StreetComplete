### New language

- Korean by Dongha Hwang

### New quests

- **Add sidewalk**: Does this street have a sidewalk? (#152)
- **Add accessible on foot**: Is this street accessible for pedestrians here?

### Improvements

- Quests previously hidden can now be made visible again through an option in the settings (#302, #1302) by @ENT8R
- All "other answer..." options that lead to another dialog, the text now ends with a "..." (#1296, #1274)
- clarify wording in maxspeed quest (use "built-up area" instead of "urban") (#1314)
- the choices in the crops quest are now sorted with new UN FAO data (#1319) by @rugk
- Show the tactile paving bus stop quests for ways as well (#1309) by @MrKrisKrisu
- when showing a quest for an element (e.g. a shop) that is not at street level, show additionally on which floor it is located (#1270, #1326)

### Fixes

- fix missing pictures in building type and surface selection quests in Android 4.4 and below (#1317)
- fix sometimes quests were still being generated even though there was a note for that element (#1089)
- exclude roads from the oneway quest where its direction can not be determined reliably (#1320)

### Technical

- Migrate parts of the code from Java to Kotlin, lots of refactoring, use Android Kotlin extensions
- Migrate from appcompat to androidx, migrate from `evernote.android-job` to `work.work-runtime` library
- Use R8 instead of ProGuard

For the average user, this means that this version will probably be more unstable than v9 at the start. (There have been 3 beta releases before this first production release)
