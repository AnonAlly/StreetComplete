The grant from the [Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de/en/project/streetcomplete/) ended in February, however, there is one last big mega-update I can delight you with before development on this app must necessarily wind down:  
It may not look like a lot, but I basically replaced the whole architecture of the app (#2506, ...) to do this. Note that this required dropping most local data, such as unsynced edits, downloaded quests and statistics.  
Special thanks to @FloEdelmann for helping with the refactor.

### üîôÔ∏è Superpowered Undo

- You can now **undo any edit** that hasn't been uploaded yet:  
  quest answers, split ways, deleted places, hidden quests, created notes and note comments (#1029, #2616)
- You can now look at your **edit history** and undo any recent edit in any order, not just the last one
- It is now shown what exactly is tagged for each edit in the edit history
- You can now undo deletions of places even after you have uploaded it (#2441)

### ‚õ∞Ô∏è Improved usability and offline mode

- Immediately unlock new quests based on the one you just solved, **even when offline**. This has been a much requested feature but was simply not possible with the previous architecture (#1369, #1510, #1550, #1826, #2254, #2438, #2473, #2474, #2676, #2743...)
- The above also works when splitting a way. The quests for the split segments will be shown immediately
- When you scan for quests manually, no cache will be used: you always get the freshest data (#2554)
- When unable to fully upload pictures attached to a note due to a bad connection, the app will try again later (#2102)
