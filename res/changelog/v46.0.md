### New Quests

Asked for campsites (#4213), by @mnalis:

- _Who may camp here?_
- _Are there showers here?_
- _Is drinking water available here?_
- _Is there any power supply here?_

### Disabled Quests

_Orchard produce_, _Building levels_, _Sidewalks_ and _Lit roads_ are now disabled by default because either they are replaced by designated overlays or they overwhelm users (#4264,...).  
You can enable them again in the settings at any time.
