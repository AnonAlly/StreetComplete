### Standalone measuring app

Measuring distances with the camera has been outsourced into a standalone app, so you can also measure things outside of the context of solving quests: [StreetMeasure](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.westnordost.streetmeasure)

This has been done for licensing reasons (see #4289). In a nutshell, ARCore (= [Google Play Services for AR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core)), on which the measuring is dependent on, is not open source.  
 This is why it is also not available on the main repo in F-Droid. If you do not have Google Play, you can [download the APK from GitHub](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetMeasure/releases), but then you also need to install ARCore.
