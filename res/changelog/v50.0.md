### üö≤Ô∏èÔ∏è Cycleway Overlay (#4657, #4233)

There is a new overlay which allows you to review and edit the streetside cycleway infrastructure as well as whether there is any segregation on combined foot- and cycle paths. Sponsored by [FixMyCity](https://www.fixmycity.de/).

"It‚Äôs at slightly different position‚Ä¶" is a new generic answer available for every POI-based quest and overlay. It lets you correct the position of the POI.

### Enhanced Overlays

- Sidewalks: Missing sidewalk information on unpaved roads and on roads with a very low speed limit are not shown in red
- Sidewalks: Support sidewalks mapped on exclusive cycleways
- Street parking: Fix a crash when editing partially (#4634)
- Shops: Add option to explicitly state that a shop has no name (#4648)
- Shops: Fix removing localized names did not actually remove them
- Other small enhancements (see #4657)

### Enhanced Quests

- Surfaces for segregated foot and cycleway: Correct common surface (#4615), by @mnalis
- Disabled cycleway quest by default because it can be done more comprehensively in the overlay
- Road width: Ask for confirmation when adding improbable road widths (#4655)
- Other small enhancements (#4637, #4643, #4649...), thanks @matkoniecz, @tapetis

### Other enhancements and fixes

- Added language: Serbian in latin script (automatically generated from Serbian in cyrillic script)
- Fix quest pins sometimes disappear and labels flicker on moving the map (#4522), by @Helium314
