A pretty long list for a bugfix update! To be honest, I squeezed in some tiny features:

- on handling a conflict, recheck if the quest still applies to the updated element (#720)
- fix another crash and a memory leak
- fix crash when unable to create file for taking a photo
- add new language Slovak by Vlado Jendrol and updated other languages

**Add opening hours quest:**

- don't allow the user add an empty opening hours description (#721)

**Add maxspeed quest:**

- clearer wording on confirmation of no sign posted for a street (#715)
- exclude unpaved roads from maxspeed quest (#752)
- allow the user to specify the speed unit in certain currently-mph countries

**Add cycleway quest:**

- don't ask for a cycleway on areas (#711)
- fix crash when inputting certain values for cycleways (#740)
- fix rare crash when rotating the map while specifying the cycleway
- don't display the quest for Android <4.4 users (#713)
- always tag oneway:bicycle=no for oneways with bicycle infrastructure for contraflow direction (#717)
- for oneways in contraflow, replace "sharrows" option with option to state that a oneway road is not oneway for cyclists (but has still no dedicated cycleway) (#717)
- show compass needle in cycleway form (#723)
- limit cycleway quests to a few countries which are likely to have any bicycle infrastructure (#749)
