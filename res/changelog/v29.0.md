### üó∫Ô∏è Map available offline!

In the area quests are downloaded, the background map is now also downloaded into the cache.  
  
So, when you are offline later, you can continue to use this app in that area without any problem because the background is also available (#122, #2428).  
  
To download not at your current GPS location but somewhere else, just pan and zoom to that location and tap "search for quests here" in the menu.
