### Measure with the camera (AR)

Measuring with AR is only supported [on certain devices](https://developers.google.com/ar/devices#google%5Fplay%5Fdevices) and you need to have the Google Play Services on your phone. If AR is not available, the new quests are disabled by default because you'd need to use a tape measure instead. (#3709, #879)

### New Quests

- _What’s the width of this cycleway here?_ (#698)
- _What’s the width of this road here?_
- _What is the height limit here?_

### Quest enhancements

- Add "handlebar holders" as bicycle parking type option (#3061, #3724), by @sams96

- Other small improvements (#3740, #3755, #3793, #3783, #3814, #3811), thanks @matkoniecz, @tiptoptom, @peternewman, @arrival-spring
