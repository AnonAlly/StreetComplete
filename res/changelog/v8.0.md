### UX Enhancements

- **Redesign quest forms and dialogs to a new look** (this is quite huge) (#1158)
- when leaving a note, it is done in the bottom sheet instead of in a dialog now so that you can still see the quest geometry
- solve performance problems when downloading quests (especially housenumbers and building types)
- only play sound effects when system setting for that is enabled (fixes #1187) and in "media" instead of "notification" stream (#1167)
- In notes, shortcut the link to the element to `https://osm.org/way/...` for better readability of notes left by SC users (#1178)
- tapping on the quest title now toggles expanding the quest to full size and back
- it is now again possible to attach photos to notes
- add "deselect all" button in the quest selection screen (#1203)

### Quests

- **new** Railway crossing: _How is this railway crossing protected?_
- Redesign note discussion quest (new: avatars displayed also) to make it look like a chat
- Surface and building type quest: When tapping to expand a category, the view scrolls down to show the expanded items
- Cycleway quest: Exclude motorroads

### Other & Bugfixes

- StreetComplete is now ready for GDPR-related changes made to the OSM api
- solve quest upload problem for quests on relations when phone locale is set to a Turkic language
