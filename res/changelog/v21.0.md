### üó∫Ô∏è New Map Provider

Big thanks to [JawgMaps](https://www.jawg.io), a provider of online custom maps, geocoding and routing based on OpenStreetMap data. They are providing their vector map tiles service to StreetComplete for free!  
Their maps are also quite excellent: You can look forward to **daily map updates** and **map loading times cut in half**, as their map data is very lightweight.

But let's not forget to thank @Akasch for hosting the previous solution with zero budget over the last years and maintaining it in his free time. Without his endeavor, there likely wouldn't have been a map at all in this time.
