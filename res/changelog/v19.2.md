Maybe the announced end of new (big) features for StreetComplete is not over yet! I applied to two microgrants at the OpenStreetMap Foundation, you can endorse them if you like these ideas:

1. [StreetComplete as an entry point to OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Microgrants/Microgrants%5F2020/Proposal/StreetComplete%5Fas%5Fan%5Fentry%5Fpoint%5Fto%5FOpenStreetMap)
2. [Map maintenance with StreetComplete](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Microgrants/Microgrants%5F2020/Proposal/Map%5FMaintenance%5Fwith%5FStreetComplete)

### Fixes

- updated translations
- don't show map context menu while bottom sheet is open (#1820)
- cycleway type quest: for oneway roads, always only ask for the traffic flow direction side of the road (#1822, thanks @peternewman)
- fix problem where the quest type bubbles in the statistics view would not have enough space (#1818)
- when turning off GPS, also do not show the compass direction (#1823)
- fix download icon would get stuck if the app was disconnected during download (#1821)
- fix crash when app was disconnected directly after login
