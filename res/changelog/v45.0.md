### üç∞ Overlays!

Make every survey unique! How? Dedicate each to updating a different aspect of the map by activating a different overlay, respectively!

This is **for advanced users** who want to be more efficient in adding and maintaining certain data area-wide. Read more in [this blog post](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/westnordost/diary/399378)!

For now, there are only overlays for _street lighting_ and for _sidewalks_, more will be added over time. üéâ (#2461, #2506, #3920, #3644)
