This one is a huge release, maybe the biggest one yet! But don't get used to it, I have been working on it full-time for a few months but must soon return to work life as my savings are running low. That being said, you **can** donate, check the about screen 😛.  
You can also read this list of changes later in that screen if you are impatient now.

### 🗺️ Reworked main screen UI

- **👨‍🏫 Added small tutorial**, only shown when the app is first installed (#178, #1552)
- Removed app bar, map now expands over status and navigation bar
- New main menu with bigger icons
- More informative **download indicator**
- **Notifications button** shows news, like this changelog or new mail in your OpenStreetMap inbox (#1690, #1751)
- Notes are now created via long-press

### Added profile screen

- Login to OSM now happens within the app and not the browser, solves login problems for some users (#1760, #413, #804)
- Your solved **quest count is now synchronized** across your devices and when you reinstall the app
- Undone quest answers are now correctly counted as -1 to your quest count, so after synchronization your count may be a little lower than before
- **⭐ Added statistics of your solved quests** and links with more information for each quest type (#80, #1294). Try rotating it!
- **🏆 You can now earn achievements** which in turn unlock interesting OpenStreetMap related links and add them to your collection! (#1715, #1749, #1009)
