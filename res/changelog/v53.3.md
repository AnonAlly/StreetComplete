### Unmaintained translations

Translations to Turkish, Malayalam, Amharic, Armenian, Bosnian, Norwegian Nyorsk, Galician and Japanese haven't been maintained for over half a year.

As a native speaker of any of these languages, you can [help translate the app](https://poeditor.com/join/project/IE4GC127Ki) in order to retain this translation in the app.

To avoid an awkward mix of properly localized and English texts all over the app that wouldn't be usable by people who do not understand both languages, languages whose translation completeness becomes too low are removed from the app and only re-added when they reach near 100% again.
