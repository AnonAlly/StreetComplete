### Easier orientation

üñäÔ∏è The path you went today with the app is now marked on the map for better orientation! (#2209)

The location button (lower right corner) also has a new behavior:

- üõ∞Ô∏è Tap it once to let the view follow your position on the map (icon turns orange)
- üö¥ Tap it again to let the view rotate with the direction you are going (icon turns into an arrow). Very helpful for cyclists! (#1040, #2191, #3335)

Furthermore, the only thing the compass button now does is to rotate the view back to north-up and it is only displayed if the map is not displayed north-up.
