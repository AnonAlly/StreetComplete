- Fix a crash (#5066, #5073) by @Helium314
- Multilingual (street) names: More and more fine-grained suggestions which languages to add in which regions. E.g. German in Italy only selectable in Trentino-SÃ¼dtirol, etc.
- Fix edits done in the shop overlay (and more) didn't actually count in the statistics (#5074)
- Other small fixes and enhancements (#5062, #5076, #5068, #5071, #5010, #5082...), thanks @Helium314, @tapetis
